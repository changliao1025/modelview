# modelview
ModelView is a C++ program to generate Kitware VTK file for visualization.
https://vtk.org

The major application/usage of this tool includes producing a VTK mesh file for the USGS MODFLOW model.

It will supports unstructured mesh grid in the near future.

This tool will only produce to VTK file, the users should use VisIt or ParaView to visualize the data.
